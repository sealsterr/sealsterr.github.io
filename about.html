                    <p style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> Okay, seriously now. I'm a teenager with a terrible sense of humor (for reference I know almost every single Chuck Norris joke out there) who also likes programming, fencing, listening to music and I am a professional sleeper.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> I have been thinking about my future a lot, and I decided that I want to be a game developer. I'm currently trying to balance staying inside the house like a Discord moderator and code and hanging out with friends. Not gonna lie, it's going pretty well so far. </p>
                    <i> <p style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> If I say I know coding it doesn't mean I can fix your printer. </p> </i>
                    <p style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> I have been fencing since I was in first grade, which means almost 9 years at this moment. I consider myself a somewhat good fencer, I collected a few trophies and medals. Unfortunately, I'm not a very big guy, which can be a huge disadvantage.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> I may have the messiest music taste ever. I listen to almost every genre of music, from rock to phonk to even jazz mainly because I share a Spotify account with my sister. I really like to listen to Sabaton and Rammstein on the rock side, on the other side I also listen to Queen, ABBA, and several solo artists like Cheri Cheri Lady by Modern Talking (I know technically they're two but still). </p>
                    <i> <p style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> Listening songs based on your mood is a very pleasant thing to do. </p> </i>
                    <p style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> The main purpose of this site is to serve as a time capsule for myself. Maybe I'll come back to this page 5 years later, let's see where I have gotten. It could be a huge disappointment or the feeling of success. Hey older me! </p>
